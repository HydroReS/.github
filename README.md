Welcome to the Hydrology and Remote Sensing (HydroReS) group

The group is led by Dr. Efthymios Nikolopoulos and focuses on research that lies at the intersection of hydrology, hydrometeorology, and remote sensing. Our work involves the application of state-of-art remote sensing observations in combination with numerical and statistical modeling in order to advance the understanding and predictability of hydroclimatic extremes and associated hazards and their impacts on water and energy resources.
